## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project in a live environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9.x or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized development)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (for Python dependency management)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for the database)

You will also need:
- A Google Cloud account with Calendar API and Vision API enabled
- OpenAI API key for certain AI functionalities
- Dify AI account for RAG chatbot implementation
- PostgreSQL connection string for database access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nobu-h-o/Calendxr.git
   cd Calendxr
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   
   Both the frontend and backend directories have their own environment configurations:
    
   #### Frontend Environment
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your values:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
    
   #### Backend Environment
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your values:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Required API keys and credentials:
    - Google OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret)
    - Google Cloud Vision API key
    - OpenAI API key
    - Dify API key and endpoint
    - NextAuth URL and secret
    - PostgreSQL database connection string
    
   Make sure to populate all necessary variables in both environment files for the application to function correctly.

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. Choose one of the following development methods:

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

Run the entire application stack using Docker:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### Running Frontend and Backend Separately

**For the frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**For the backend:**
```bash
cd backend
poetry update
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- **Ephemeral Processing:** Your uploaded images for event creation are processed and then immediately discarded.

- **Minimal Permissions:** We only request the minimum Google Calendar permissions needed for the app to function.
