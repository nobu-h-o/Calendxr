## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the issue, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker as you might find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

**How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nobu-h-o/Calendxr/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Calendxr's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Calendxr
- Enable a sustainable system for Calendxr's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md or relevant documentation with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, etc.
3. The PR should work for both frontend and backend (if applicable). Ensure tests pass for both environments.
4. The PR may be merged once it receives approval from at least one other developer and project maintainer.
